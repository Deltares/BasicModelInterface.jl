# BasicModelInterface

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Deltares/BasicModelInterface.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Deltares/BasicModelInterface.jl/actions) 

[Basic Model Interface](https://bmi.csdms.io/en/stable/) (BMI) specification for the
[Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). This package contains all 41 functions
that are part of the BMI 2.0 specification. These functions are declared without any
methods, like so: `function initialize end`. They do have documentation that shows how they
should be used.

It is up to model specific implementations to extend the functions defined here, adding
methods for their own model type, such as:

```julia
import BasicModelInterface as BMI

# any type you created to represent your model
struct MyModel end

function BMI.update(model::MyModel)::Nothing
    # write MyModel update implementation here
end
```

This package is currently being developed independently of
[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page)(CSDMS).
After it has been proven successful with several Julia BMI implementations, we should
consider proposing CSDMS adoption as well, to join the existing C, C++, Fortran and Python
specifications.

## Notes and open questions

This specification is adopted from the [BMI 2.0 Python specification](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-python/blob/v2.0/bmipy/bmi.py).
Instead of Python's class methods, the Julia specification expects a `model` parameter
as the first argument. Julia will dispatch to the right implementation based on the type
of the `model` parameter.

We do not apply the Julia convention to put a ! after mutating function names, to keep
the function names consistent with the other languages.

- Time must be a float.
- Grid is an integer grid identifier.
- Units should be string.

See if we can instead use richer types that keep more information,
yet still convert to the right `Int64`, `Float64`, `String`, etc.

`get_grid_shape`: Instead of passing in a `Vector` to fill, do not require a shape argument,
    and return a `Tuple`, like the `size` function.

> Constructs and features that are natural for the language should be used when implementing
a BMI. BMI strives to be developer-friendly.

> BMI functions always use flattened, one-dimensional arrays. This avoids any issues stemming
from row/column-major indexing when coupling models written in different languages. It’s the
developer's responsibility to ensure that array information is flattened/redimensionalized
in the correct order.

From the above and the [get_grid_shape](https://bmi.csdms.io/en/stable/bmi.grid_funcs.html#get-grid-shape)
docs it is not quite clear yet what the correct order is. Flattening a row-array and a
column-major array will result in the same size but different order array.

> “ij” indexing (as opposed to “xy”)

Does `i` here stand for the first dimension, regardless of row/column-major indexing?

> the length of the z-dimension, nz, would be listed first.

If the z-dimension needs to go first, that means different z at the same xy location will
be close in memory for column-major, and far in memory for row-major.
